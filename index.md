Hi!
My name is Kalpana Joshi.

My brag sheet information includes being a wind instrument player on the East Brunswick Marching Band. I've played the flute and piccolo, and have marched various competitions throughout the New Jersey region with the band. Next, I'm a member of National Honor Society. Upon getting accepted into the chapter in December 2020, I have tutored kids in middle school, helped design pages for the schoolwide cookbook, and made greeting cards for the local hospital. Lastly, I enjoy casual photography; I use a Nikon DLSR camera when traveling, and enjoy taking pictures of nature, world landmarks, and even of my family!

Thank you for viewing my website! Have a good day!
