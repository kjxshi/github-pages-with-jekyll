Hi!
My name is Kalpana Joshi.

Here is a picture of me:

My brag sheet information includes my job as a Target manager; I initially worked at Target for 2 years as a general Sales Associate, and then got promoted to manager position. I work with the other general managers to make sure everything is smooth and running. Next, I am the Student Council President at my high school. I organize school events, charity fundraisers, bake sales, and plan out activities for teachers. As the head of the student body, I stay organized and busy at all times. Finally, you can find me doing some simple photography; using my DSLR camera, I like casually taking photographs of nature.

Thank you for viewing my website! Have a good day!
